Welcome! I am **Wenqin Liu**, a PhD candidate in Science at the University of Melbourne. My research lies at the intersection of **causal discovery**, **machine learning**, and **spatiotemporal generative modeling**. I aim to develop **robust and identifiable learning frameworks** that advance our understanding of dynamic, uncertain systems — from theoretical foundations to real-world applications.

### 🧪 Research Experience
- **PhD Researcher**, University of Melbourne  
  Leading research on *SkewScore* and *MissScore* — novel methods for causal discovery under heteroscedastic noise and missingness. Developed a theoretical framework for latent spatiotemporal PDEs.

- **Visiting Student Researcher**, UC San Diego (2024–2025)  
  Co-led skewness-based score research under Prof. Biwei Huang. Focused on both theoretical justifications and empirical evaluations.

- **Research Intern**, OPPO Research Institute, Beijing (2022)  
  Created facial image synthesis tools using GANs. Bridged research ideas to production-level tools.

- **Academic Tutor**, University of Melbourne (2023–Present)  
  Designed and taught tutorials and assessments for *Statistical Modelling*, *Decision Making*, and *Machine Learning* postgraduate courses.
