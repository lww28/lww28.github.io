Welcome! I am Wenqin Liu, a Ph.D. candidate in Science at the University of Melbourne, where I am advised by Dr. Mingming Gong, Prof. Howard Bondell, and Dr. Qiuhong Ke. My research lies at the intersection of **causal discovery**, **machine learning**, and **spatiotemporal modeling**, with a particular focus on developing robust and identifiable frameworks for complex, dynamic systems.

In 2024–2025, I had the privilege of visiting **UC San Diego**, where I worked closely with **Prof. Biwei Huang**. This experience has greatly enriched my perspective and continues to influence the direction and impact of my research.
