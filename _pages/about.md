Welcome! I am Wenqin Liu, a Ph.D. candidate in Science at the University of Melbourne, where I am advised by [Dr. Mingming Gong](https://mingming-gong.github.io/), [Prof. Howard Bondell](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/600991-howard-bondell), and [Dr. Qiuhong Ke](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/qiuhong-ke). My research lies at the intersection of **causal discovery**, **machine learning**, and **spatiotemporal modeling**, with a particular focus on developing robust and identifiable frameworks for complex, dynamic systems.

In 2024‚Äì2025, I had the opportunity to visit UC San Diego, working under the guidance of [Prof. Biwei Huang](https://biweihuang.com). This learning experience has been deeply valuable in advancing my Ph.D. research.
